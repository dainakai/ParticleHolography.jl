    Labonte(dict1, dict2; Dmax=50.0, α=0.005, R=50.0, Rend=0.1, β=0.9, N=10)

Implementation of the improved Labonté algorithm [ohmi, labonte](@cite). Takes dictionaries of detected particle coordinates at two time points as input and returns a graph representing the correspondence between particles at these two time points. The graph contains UUID keys of all particles from both time points as nodes, with directed edges representing particle correspondences from particles in `dict1` to particles in `dict2`. All correspondences can be retrieved using the [`enum_edge`](@ref enum_edge) function.

# Arguments
- `dict1::Dict{UUID, Vector{Float32}}`: Dictionary of detected particle coordinates at the first time point.
- `dict2::Dict{UUID, Vector{Float32}}`: Dictionary of detected particle coordinates at the second time point.

# Optional keyword arguments
- `Dmax::Float32=50.0`: Maximum allowable movement distance.
- `α::Float32=0.005`: Learning rate.
- `R::Float32=50.0`: Initial value of the inspection neighborhood radius.
- `Rend::Float32=0.1`: Final value of the inspection neighborhood radius. The algorithm terminates when the inspection radius becomes smaller than this value through iterations.
- `β::Float32=0.9`: Decay rate of the inspection neighborhood radius.
- `N::Int=10`: Nodes that are not selected as winners for N consecutive times are removed. Refer to the original paper for details.

# Returns
- `MetaGraph`: Graph representing the correspondence between detected particles at two time points.
